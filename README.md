**Classification of Bleached, Healthy and Dead Corals using CNN**

**Overview and Background**

This project is related to my recent work published in the MDPI Big Data and Cognative Computing journal. In this project, I will use the dataset that we created for the article [1]. This work was completely implemented in MATLAB but in this project I have developed a new CNN model to solve this problem.

The dataset can be accessed publicly from kaggle [2].
